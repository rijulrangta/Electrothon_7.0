# JavaScript Performance Optimizations

## Key Performance Issues Identified
- High JavaScript execution time (2.5s)
- Large library dependencies (@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web, gsap, etc.)
- Simultaneous loading of all components
- Development tools impacting performance (WDYR)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting with Dynamic Imports
- Converted static imports to dynamic imports using Next.js's `dynamic` function
- Only the MainPg component is loaded immediately
- Other components are loaded on demand
- Benefits: Reduced initial JavaScript payload and parsing time

### 2. Intersection Observer for Lazy Loading
- Components only load when they scroll into view
- Placeholder divs maintain layout until content loads
- 300px buffer for preloading before components are visible
- Benefits: Progressive loading, reduced initial execution time

### 3. Why Did You Render (WDYR) Optimization
- Now only enabled with URL parameter: `?enableWDYR=true`
- More efficient configuration with reduced tracking
- Completely disabled in production
- Benefits: Development performance improved without losing debugging ability

### 4. Webpack and Next.js Optimizations
- Improved code splitting
- Better package import optimization
- Smart chunking for large libraries
- Benefits: Smaller, more efficient bundles

### 5. Resource Prioritization
- Used requestIdleCallback for non-critical operations
- Delayed loading of non-essential scripts
- Better browser idle time utilization
- Benefits: Better prioritization of important resources

### 6. Bundle Analysis Tools
- Added webpack-bundle-analyzer integration
- Created scripts for analyzing bundle size
- Benefits: Ongoing bundle size monitoring and optimization

## Expected Results
- **Initial Load Time**: ~40-50% reduction
- **JavaScript Execution Time**: ~40-60% reduction
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: ~40-60% reduction
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: ~20-30% improvement

## Usage Instructions

### Development with Performance Analysis
```
npm run analyze
```

### Using WDYR for Debugging
Add `?enableWDYR=true` to your development URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/?enableWDYR=true
```

### Production Build
```
npm run build
```
