# Main Thread Work Optimizations

## Performance Issues Addressed
- High main thread work time (2.1s)
- Script Evaluation (758ms)
- Garbage Collection (198ms)
- Script Parsing & Compilation (184ms)
- Render Delay affecting LCP (93% of 2,640ms)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Component Rendering Optimization
- Implemented React.memo for the Home component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used useReducer instead of useState for managing visible sections to reduce state updates
- Memoized expensive functions with useCallback and useMemo
- Added custom placeholder components to reduce DOM complexity

### 2. Enhanced Lazy Loading Strategy
- Prioritized dynamic imports based on user visibility and importance
- Added better loading placeholders with animation-pulse effect for improved UX
- Increased preloading distance for smoother transitions (400px buffer)
- Reduced loading delay from 300ms to 200ms for faster initial render

### 3. Main Thread Workload Reduction
- Implemented temporary animation disabling during initial page load
- Used passive event listeners for improved scroll performance
- Added script deferral for non-critical third-party scripts
- Implemented regular memory cleanup to reduce garbage collection frequency

### 4. CSS Performance Improvements
- Added content-visibility: auto for the largest contentful paint element
- Added reduce-animation class to temporarily disable animations during load
- Used contain-intrinsic-size to prevent layout shifts during loading

### 5. JavaScript Execution Optimization
- Created a main-thread-optimizer.js script to detect performance issues
- Generated specific optimization suggestions for components
- Documented performance best practices for ongoing development

## Expected Results
- **Main Thread Work**: ~40-50% reduction (from 2.1s to ~1.1s)
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: ~40-60% improvement (reducing 2,470ms render delay)
- **Script Evaluation**: ~50% reduction (from 758ms to ~380ms)
- **Garbage Collection**: ~70% reduction (from 198ms to ~60ms)

## Ongoing Optimization Recommendations
1. Review and optimize @lottiefiles/dotlottie-web usage (largest contributor to JS execution time)
2. Consider virtualizing any long lists of items (sponsors, testimonials, etc.)
3. Further audit third-party scripts and extensions causing performance issues
4. Implement resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch) for external resources
5. Monitor and optimize the critical rendering path in production

## Usage
- Run `node main-thread-optimizer.js` to generate specific optimization suggestions
- Check the browser console for performance metrics during development
- Use the optimization suggestions as a reference when building new components
